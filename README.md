# Swamp-Hero-64

This is a submission for the "N64brew Spooky Jam" 2022. I'm a beginner in designing and developing N64 homebrew games.
"Swamp Hero 64" is my first try to build a N64 game. With of the use of the Visual Studio project based game engine "UltraEd" from the developer "deadcast2" (look at his good github profile and software! Thank you very much deadcast2) it was possible for me to made my first steps in N64 developing.
I used the "tank" example from "deadcast2" which is part of the UltraEd engine Version 1.0. I build the models of the ghosts and the level objects by my own. The textures for the surfaces (swamp ground and house) are based from texture files of "Screaming Brain Studios" (under the CC0/Public Domain License) - thank you very much.

I learned a lot by reading the N64brew-discort channel entries. Thank you for all people who organized the yearly N64brew jam. I like the entries from past years very much and reading about it on the N64squid site. When I first saw this site I had the wish to be a part of a N64 homebrew developing project. I had moral support from my family and testing support from my kids.
The game isnâ€™t very long or complex, but I'm proud of having produced this little software for one of my favorite consoles.

Thank you to all of the N64brew community.
